Thank you for providing that output! It's a good start.

It looks like the output was cut off. The line `INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories:` suggests that Uvicorn is trying to start and monitor for file changes.

To help me further, please copy and paste the **entire** output you see in your terminal after running `uvicorn main:app --reload`. I need everything, from the moment you type the command until it either shows a complete server startup message or a full error. There might be important information after the truncated line.
