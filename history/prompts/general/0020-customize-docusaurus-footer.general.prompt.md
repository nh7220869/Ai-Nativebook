  I have customized the Docusaurus footer configuration in `docusaurus.config.ts` to better reflect the book's content. The "Docs" section was renamed to "Book" with relevant links, the "Community" section was updated with specific links, and the copyright text now explicitly references "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with "All rights reserved."
outcome: Footer now aligns with the book's context and branding.
